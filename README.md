## Instructions
1. There is a data file that contains the elevation of the state of Colorado broken into 1x1 foot squares. Fill a 2D array of ints with this data by completing the function fillGrid().
1. You will eventually use the data in the array to draw the map, but first find the minimum and maxiumum values in the array by completing getMin() and getMax() run the code. 

   **Checkpoint:** After this step, the Lowest Elevation and Highest Elevation will print to the console.
